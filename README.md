# ðŸ›‘ Street Sign Detector

This project implements and compares two pipelines for detecting street signs in images:

- âœ… A **Classical Computer Vision Pipeline** using OpenCV and color/edge-based techniques
- ðŸ§  A **Neural Network (CNN) Pipeline** using PyTorch for direct bounding box regression

It benchmarks both approaches on the [GTSRB Final Test set](#dataset-gtsrb) using IoU-based metrics.
